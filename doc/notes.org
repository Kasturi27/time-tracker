** Things to fix, potentially
- consider moving core -> web/service, and routes into web/routes
- probably don't rewrite all logging macros just to add json/encode. Look at ns-resolve.
- move config `def`s out of code, and into config file
- try to move integer/parseInt higher up; biz logic shouldn't do param parsing
- move addition of duration into applicaiton layer. more generally, move biz logic into application layer.

** standard web service stack
- authentication
- authorization
- validation
- coercion
- midldeware
- logging
- monitoring
